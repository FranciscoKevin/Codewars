# Summary
Codewars is a platform for developers to improve by solving programming exercises called kata. These exercises target various computer skills available in many languages and developers complete them using an online IDE. Developers can compare their solutions and create their own kata. Katas are listed in order of difficulty, ranging from 8th kyu (the entry level) to 1st kyu (the current highest level).
